<p><em><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Writing proposals in Word and Google Docs is rather unpleasant. Since I write the majority of them, I fantasized about composing them just using semantic HTML, a little CSS and JavaScript (to do numeric calculations automatically).

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Academic &amp; Research Computing (ARC) had originally developed the current Video Coding Project (VCP v2). Regional Research Institute (RRI) has approached ARC to take the application into its next phase of development with VCP v3.  This proposal serves to outline time and cost estimates for this development.  This first section contains information regarding the document itself as well as client/developer contact information. Section 2 overviews the system; detailing purpose, scope, and project estimates. Section 3 is a list of features that shall be implemented by the system. Requirements and time estimates will be included for each feature. Section 4 details pricing information.</p>

<h1>System Overview</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The object of this project is move the existing VCP v2 functionality and content from Drupal 7 into the Python Django framework. The site will maintain its existing functionality with the benefit of being easier to maintain and upgrade within its new framework habitat. This framework move will allow us to clean up existing functionality provided by Drupal that is unnecessary within the context of application as well as implement additional features as requested by the client.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>Setup external media server for hosting &amp; converting video files.
Move existing application functionality from Drupal CMS to Django framework.
Migrate existing content from current VCP sites into new application.
</p>

<h2>Project estimates</h2>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Project Management</th>
        <td>?? hours @ $35/hr</td>
        <td>$???</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Basic Web Development</th>
        <td>?? hours @ $35/hr</td>
        <td>$???</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <th>Total</th>
        <td>$???</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Project deadline</h2>
<p> All work as outlined within this proposal shall be completed by mm/dd/yy. This  date is a projected deadline and may change according to project needs.</p>

<h2>Project risks</h2>
<p>Depending on HIPAA regulations, we may need HIPPA approved web servers and encryption to store data generated by users of VCP. Any extra data storage regulations may add time and cost to the project due to changes necessary to integrate the application with a different server system. </p>

<h1>Deliverables</h1>
<h2>A truck</h2>
<h3>And stuff</h3>
<p>blah</p>
<h3>And stuff</h3>
<h4>And stuff</h4>
<h5>And stuff</h5>
<h6>And stuff</h6>
<p>blah</p>

<h1>Pricing, Costs, and Invoicing</h1>
<p>All estimates for cost are based on OIT/ARC standardized, maximum prices for programming and development work, effective for fiscal year 2013 -14.   They are summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>dard programming/web programming, database programming, web development and project maintenance - $50/hr.</li>
    <li>Advanced programming/web programming, database development, consulting, advanced analysis, and project management - $75/hr.</li>
</ul>

<p>ARC pricing is intended to cover costs, while offering PSU researchers and associated agencies excellent value for professional development and programming services.  In addition, we offer valuable professional experience for undergraduate and graduate student programmers.</p>

<h2>Scope of work and cost</h2>
<p>Based on the agreed upon scope of work, all work will be performed to completion at the cost estimates listed here.  These charges will be less if the development time is significantly less than estimated.  If there are significant funds remaining once the work is completed, there may be resources available to add additional features and functionality.</p>

<h2>Changes to the original scope of work</h2>
<p>Changes to the original scope of work, once decided upon, will result in one or all of the following: additional cost, lengthened development time, and reduction of deliverables if budget constraints are an issue.</p>

<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<p>All bug fixes are addressed with no further charge, EXCEPT for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Browser support due to patches, version upgrades, and new browser releases.</li>
    <li>General bug fixes for work done by other contractors or site owners.</li>
</ul>

<p>This work will be charged on a time and materials basis at the standard rates listed above.</p>

<h2>Ongoing maintenance</h2>
<p>Web applications require ongoing support; browsers are constantly being upgraded and adding new technologies.  This can cause problems with existing websites, typically with JavaScript, CSS, and plug-in compatibility.  In addition, upgrades on web servers and in programming languages can cause issues as well.  Our clients may choose to handle the necessary site modifications themselves, hire an independent contractor or staff (student), or contract with ARC to provide this service. </p>

<p>ARC can implement and bill for these upgrades either on a time and materials basis, or these can be addressed as part of a budgeted, ongoing maintenance plan in a Service Level Agreement (SLA).  The terms of this maintenance plan will be based on the scope and complexity of a given project.  The SLA should be arranged prior to the completion of a project.</p>

<p>Typical maintenance addresses:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Browser support due to patches, version upgrades, and new browser releases.</li>
    <li>General bug fixes.</li>
    <li>Changes required due to normal system upgrades because of performance or security.</li>
</ul>

<p>This does not account for new features or ongoing development.  Fixes for work   done by other contractors or site owners may incur higher rates.</p>
